# Theoretical_Physics
Mechanics, electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, condensed matter theory, classical theory of fields, quantum field theory, etc. Everything about _theoretical physics_ that I know!

I will update gradually but it depends on whether I have time or not :)

NB: Some notes are poper _Latex_ but some are _Handwritten_, so take care trying to decipher my writing!
